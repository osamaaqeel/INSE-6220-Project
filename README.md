Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Predicting Obesity
Both nationally and internationally, the prevalence of obesity is rising, which is correlated with rising medical and financial expenses. The obesity epidemic is largely caused by environmental and community factors in the community and society. Although there are differences in obesity rates according to race/ethnicity, sex, gender and sexual identity, and socioeconomic status, these differences cannot be fully explained by health behaviours, socioeconomic status, or cumulative stress [1]. In this work, a large dataset with a variety of physiological and lifestyle characteristics is used to predict obesity levels using machine learning approaches. A deep neural network and logistic regression were the two predictive models used. One- hot encoding was used to transform categorical variables, and numerical features were standardised before the models were trained and evaluated on the pre-processed dataset. Logistic regression achieved 82% accuracy and neural network achieved 94.6 with a test accuracy of 93%. According to the research, obesity levels may be accurately predicted by machine learning algorithms, which may help medical experts create more indi- vidualised treatment regimens. The significance of these findings in the larger context of personalised medicine and public health management are further covered in the study.
